                    <h3>
                      How much does journalism as a profession resonate with
                      you?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      I’d like to trace back the beginning of my journalism
                      journey to my boarding school “Wellham Girls” where I
                      ended up being the editor of four magazines, including{" "}
                      <em>The News &amp; Views</em>. I went on pursuing
                      B.A.(Hons.) English from Delhi University. Post that, I
                      enrolled in a course by <em>The Indian Express</em> for a
                      year, which was more in flux, as far as my futuristic
                      plans including whether to pursue a masters or not were
                      concerned. Receiving the title of “Best All-Round Student”
                      came as a surprise to me, considering the fact that I was
                      a happy 70-80 percenter back in school, where
                      <strong>
                        I was rather more interested in reading my own books and
                        not necessarily chasing the grades.
                      </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The course served in perfect synonymity with my perception
                      of things owing to the fact that I’ve always had a keen
                      interest in understanding the worldview around me. I was a
                      massive history buff, especially World History. Reading
                      about world history, Vietnam War, Korean War, all the
                      travel in the middle-east helped me form an opinion of
                      what’s happening today because, at the end of the day,
                      it’s all interconnected. Things don’t work out until you
                      choose your own road.

                        right thing and alter the narrative.

                    <h3>What made you choose LiveWire and TheWire?</h3>
                    <p>
                      I was working at the <em>Catch News</em>, when one of the
                      Founding Editors of The Wire, Siddharth Varadarajan
                      reached out to me, and it all just worked out. I joined
                      The Wire, at a time when LiveWire was just kick-starting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And this one day, Siddharth offers me the post of
                      Editor-in-chief for LiveWire. I was a bit dicey about
                      student politics because that was not my area of expertise
                      but slowly over time, I started making it my own. Here,
                      suddenly I was in a position where I had to do all of it -
                      from ideation to execution, but finally,{" "}
                      <strong>I think I have put my stamp on it.</strong>

                      When I took over, we had 12k followers on Instagram, and
                      now, we are over 190k in 1.5 years. I always wanted it to
                      grow more organically and democratise the platform in that
                      sense. Understanding other’s perspective has always been
                      in alignment with my high EQ, ever since I was a kid, and
                      LiveWire allowed me to put that into good use.

                      Our inbox is open for anyone and everyone. Right when
                      lockdown started, we jumped from getting about 25 emails a
                      day to about 80 emails. I spent 3-4 hours with just my
                      mailbox. On Monday, I get hit by a brick wall and tell
                      myself to breathe. My only other colleague at the editor’s
                      desk, Tanya Jha, is the most dependable person I’ve ever
                      come across. Our illustrator, Pariplab Chakroborty, brings
                      life to a lot of copies.

                      Many people write to me because they don&apos;t have anyone to
                      talk to. But when I read their writings, I find it hard to
                      use them because they&apos;re not written well or they&apos;re too
                      raw and emotional. Even though I try to give them a
                      chance, it&apos;s tough for me to work with those pieces. It&apos;s
                      really difficult to reject those pieces and sometimes I
                      end up saying things like &quot;things will get better&quot; to
                      provide some comfort to them. However, later on, I do feel
                      guilty because I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m actually helping
                      them. I believe my job falls into a gray area where it&apos;s
                      hard to determine what exactly I should do. But sometimes
                      people just need to hear the right words, and I try my
                      best to offer them that.

                      For me, LiveWire has always been reflecting the voice of
                      the masses and the reality in a very raw yet relatable
                      way, was it a conscious attempt on the part of creators
                      and editors, or is it something that gradually developed
                      over time?

                    <p>
                      Absolutely, over time I&apos;ve managed to give its own voice
                      to LiveWire. Initially, when I took over, there was an age
                      limit of 28 for submitting pieces and I thought that was
                      really ageist because anyone could have an interesting
                      opinion. A 50-year-old person may have something very
                      interesting to say that could resonate with the youth, so
                      eventually, the age limit was chucked out and that was
                      wonderful because
                      <strong>
                        we have had teachers, professors, physicists, people
                        from outside India writing to us: from all walks of
                        life.
                      </strong>{" "}
                      Recently, a 60-year-old man wrote a couple of poems for
                      us. As far as it&apos;s good creative content that resonates
                      and works, it&apos;s all that matters.

                    <p>
                      It also serves as a gateway for students to talk to their
                      parents. We&apos;ve got young adults writing stories of great
                      heartache for us.

                        A lot of people go anonymously but a lot of them are
                        okay to put their name on it, and I think that&apos;s so
                        courageous

                      , talking about your family history in ways that people
                      can relate to it. Some stories that come out are just
                      horrible, teachers bullying kids, kids bullying kids. I
                      feel it&apos;s very important to get these voices out there
                      because a lot of them don&apos;t understand that they did this
                      and that they were perpetrators in school. Even if they
                      were not the bully in question, they were allowing for
                      this to happen, and we need to keep them in check.

                      LiveWire doesn&apos;t shy away from calling out those in
                      authority and starting important conversations while
                      raising uncomfortable questions. It is the sort of woke
                      platform that everyone wished for, throughout time, but
                      somewhere between the censoring and selling of media
                      houses, the idea got lost somewhere. I, personally felt
                      that the news or the opinion pieces that I earlier used to
                      come across narrated just one side of the story, and so I
                      couldn&apos;t resonate with any of it, but your work is an
                      epitome of the contrary. What and how do you think
                      LiveWire and The Wire has managed to do differently and
                      emerge as what it is today?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      We&apos;re lucky that with The Wire family, we&apos;re an
                      independent media company with no bosses except for the
                      three founding editors. We&apos;re 80% donor-funded which means
                      that no one is telling us what to do, our readers are
                      sending us money. If it&apos;s a story, it&apos;s a story without
                      any check, it&apos;s us making the call, that if a particular
                      thing needs to be represented and put out. These are
                      stories that need to be told and someone has to say it.
